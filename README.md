# Shadow Priest Added DPS Tool

Available at https://kuwarantine.github.io/sptool.

This is a tool to check how much DPS was added to the raid by the shadow priest debuffs Shadow Weaving (2% increase to shadow damage, stacks 5 times) and Misery (5% increase to all magic damage). 

Just paste in the Warcraft Logs report URL or the report ID!

## Notes
- Shadow weaving and misery stack, this is not accounted for at the moment
- Shadow weaving is assumed to be at 5 stacks

## Thanks
- [Warcraft Logs](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/) for letting me use their images
- Kalon for the report ID parsing
